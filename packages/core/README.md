## Overview

This is the core Typescript SDK for Hume's Empathic Voice Interface, making it easy to integrate the voice API into your own front-end application. This package contains helper functions for creating a client token, managing the websocket connection, and managing microphone and audio connections. The package also contains all the basic Typescript type definitions needed to interact with the voice API.
